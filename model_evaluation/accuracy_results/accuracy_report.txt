POTHOLE DETECTION MODEL - ACCURACY ANALYSIS
==========================================

CORE PERFORMANCE METRICS
------------------------
mAP@0.5 (Primary):     0.742
mAP@0.5:0.95 (Strict): 0.456
Precision:             0.681
Recall:                0.734
F1-Score:              0.707

PERFORMANCE GRADE: B (Good)

INTERPRETATION
--------------
• mAP@0.5: 74.2% accuracy at 50% IoU threshold
• Precision: 68.1% of detections are correct
• Recall: 73.4% of actual potholes are detected
• F1-Score: 70.7% harmonic mean of precision/recall

STRENGTHS
---------
• High recall - detects most potholes
• Well-balanced precision and recall

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT  
--------------------
• Model performing well

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
• Model ready for deployment

CONFIDENCE THRESHOLD GUIDANCE
----------------------------
• High Precision (fewer false alarms): Use threshold 0.5-0.7
• High Recall (catch more potholes): Use threshold 0.2-0.4  
• Balanced Performance: Use threshold 0.3-0.5
